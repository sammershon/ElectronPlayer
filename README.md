# Electron SounCloud Player

This is a simple music player built from the Electron quickstart guide. It takes a Soundcloud playlist and plays the songs in random order and has some basic controls. 

## To Use

To test out the player, first clone the repo. Next you'll want to use your terminal to navigate to the folder where the project lives and do an npm install to add all of the necessary dependencies. After that simply type npm start into your terminal and the app should launch!
